        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Nepali boutiques are vibrant small businesses that bring unique styles
          and cultural heritage to life. However, many of these boutiques face
          challenges in gaining visibility. With limited resources, only a few
          have their own websites, and most rely heavily on social media
          platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote their products. Their
          growth often depends on word-of-mouth recommendations within local
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created this directory website to bridge that gap. Our mission is
          to provide these boutiques with greater exposure and a centralized
          platform to showcase their offerings. By connecting them with a
          broader audience, we aim to empower these businesses and help them
          thrive in the digital age.
        </p>

        <p>
          This directory isn't just a listingâ€”its a stepping stone for Nepali
          boutiques to gain leverage, reach potential customers, and grow their
          presence both locally and globally. Explore the best of Nepali
          boutiques and support these incredible small businesses!
